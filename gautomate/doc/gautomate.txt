GAutomate - Version 1.2
=======================

GAutomate maps joysticks/keyboard actions to mouse manipulations on the actual gauge 
in the simulator. Opposite to other "key to mouse" translations GAutomate doesn't 
require the gauge (or its containing panel) to be visible. As long as Flight Simulator 
loads that gauge it's accessible and GAutomate will perform click, move and dragging 
operations as configured.
