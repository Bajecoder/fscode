PDFKneeboard
============

Every serious flight-simmer eventually ends up referring to charts for their
flying adventures. Whether it's a VFR sectional or more likely an approach
chart for self-study or while flying under virtual ATC services (e.g. in IVAO).

The best coverage and free source for those charts are PDF files available
for download. Unless these pilots have a second screen to render those charts
in heavyweight PDF-apps this means juggling the external application, fighting
for screen estate and struggling to have flight-simulator as well as chart 
right at hand ... without getting into each others way.

Now - imagine PDFKneeboard - this flight-sim module renders PDF documents
right inside FS9. It remembers what part of the chart the pilot is looking
at (section, zoom, rotation - for each page), it lets FS9 keep the focus, 
remembers opened charts and offers a kneeboard-toggle button. 
When the important instrument approach chart is needed a simply joystick
button click brings it right back where the pilot needs it while staying
out of the way when not needed.

Installation:
-------------

This module comes in two versions - one for Flight Simulator 9/2004, the other for FSX.
Please make sure to download the correct version and follow the exact steps below.

 FS9/2004
 --------
 
 Copy the following file into the module-directory of your local Flight Simulator 
 installation (c:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9\Modules)
 
  PDFKneeboard.dll 

 Note: previous releases also contained three more dlls 

   jpeg62.dll
   freetype6.dll
   zlib1.dll 
  
 these files are NOT provided NOR required anymore and can be deleted (optional) from
 the flight simulator directory (c:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9)

 FSX
 -------
 
 Install FSX SP2 - otherwise the module might not work on first startup:
 
  http://www.fsinsider.com/downloads/Pages/FlightSimulatorXServicePack2.aspx
 
 Copy the following file into the module-directory of your local Flight Simulator 
 installation (C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\Modules)

  PDFKneeboard.dll 

 Then open this file in a text editor (e.g. notepad) - on Windows XP
 
  C:\Documents and Settings\[your username]\Application Data\Microsoft\FSX\dll.xml
  
 on Windows Vista
 
  C:\Users\[your username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\FSX\dll.xml
  
 and add the following lines before the last line like so
 
     ....
     <Launch.Addon>
        <Name>PDFKneeboard</Name>
        <Disabled>False</Disabled>
        <Path>.\modules\pdfkneeboard.dll</Path>
        <Commandline/>
    </Launch.Addon>
   </SimBase.Document>
 
 After starting Flight Simulator X confirm that you want to run PDFKneeboard.dll
 and have FSX remember that decision.
  

 Enjoy!
