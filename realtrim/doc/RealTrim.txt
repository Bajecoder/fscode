RealTrim
========

Activate the trimming-feature via button while moving the joystick from deflection 
to neutral. The movement of the joystick is  converted into the opposite amount of 
movement of the trim-wheel. This matches real-life where the pilot trims out force 
felt on the yoke in ONE smooth operation - there's no need to chase the correct
attitude a second time with trim buttons.

 Copy the following file into the module-directory of your local Flight Simulator 
 installation (c:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9\Modules)
 
  realtrim.dll 

 FSX
 ---

 For FSX Gold/Original:

   Make sure to install FSX SP2 
 
     http://www.fsinsider.com/downloads/Pages/FlightSimulatorXServicePack2.aspx

   Copy realtrim.dll into the module-directory of your local Flight Simulator installation 
 
     C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\Modules

   You might have to have administrator rights to do so.

 For FSX Steam Edition:
 
   Install all simconnect libraries simconnect.msi (1 current, 3 legacy) from 

     C:\Steam\steamapps\common\FSX\SDK\Core Utilities Kit\SimConnect SDK\LegacyInterfaces (FSX-RTM, FSX-SP1, FSX-XPACK)
     C:\Steam\steamapps\common\FSX\SDK\Core Utilities Kit\SimConnect SDK\LIB
  
   Copy realtrim.dll into the module-directory of your Steam Flight Simulator installation 
 
      C:\Steam\steamapps\common\FSX

   You might have to have administrator rights to do so.

 Then open this file in a text editor (e.g. notepad)
 
  Windows XP    : C:\Documents and Settings\[your username]\Application Data\Microsoft\FSX\dll.xml
  Windows Vista : C:\Users\[your username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\FSX\dll.xml
  
 and add the following lines before the last line like so
 
     ....
     <Launch.Addon>
        <Name>RealTrim</Name>
        <Disabled>False</Disabled>
        <Path>.\modules\realtrim.dll</Path>
        <Commandline/>
    </Launch.Addon>
   </SimBase.Document>
 
 After starting Flight Simulator X you should be prompted to confirm that you want to run realtrim.dll
 and have FSX remember that decision.

 Enjoy!

Uninstall:
----------

 Delete RealTrim.dll from your module-directory of your local Flight
 Simulator installation (see Installation).

How To Use RealTrim:
--------------------

 After entering the sim world select "Modules|Realtrim|Trim &Button..." from the menu bar, press
 the desired trim button on any of your joysticks.

 For normal operations then simply use the joystick as usual putting the plane into the desired 
 pitch configuration (e.g. pulling on the stick for 10 deg pitch). Then press and hold the 
 trim-button and smoothly move the joystick back into its neutral position.

 Realtrim will move the trim tab accordingly as long as the trim button is pressed.

 Note: Realtrim reads and writes to ini and log file (with Logging=1) in

  Windows XP    : [Flight Simulator installation directory]/modules
  Windows Vista : %LOCALAPPDATA%\realtrim (typically C:\Users\[your username]\AppData\Local\realtrim)
